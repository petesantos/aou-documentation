This is a repository to hold all AoU documentation.

The primary goal of this repo is to improve access to documentation.

Issues that need to be addressed:

1. Searchability of general documentation
1. Transparency in design docs
1. Ability to track changes in design docs 
1. Keeping design and documentation close to the source code
1. Tracking which designs are looking for feedback
1. Easy "world view" of all documentation / keeping all docs in one place
1. Make it harder to accidentally modify a document
1. Make it easier to identify duplicate efforts
1. Have one known location a user can go to and be able to navigate to the doc they need
